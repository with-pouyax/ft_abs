# ft_abs


Welcome to the `FT_ABS` library repository. This library provides a simple yet powerful macro, `ABS`, designed to compute the absolute value of an integer in C. By encapsulating the functionality in a macro that calls a static inline function, it offers both readability and efficiency.

## Overview

The `FT_ABS` library defines:
- A static inline function `ft_abs` that calculates the absolute value of an integer.
- A macro `ABS` that serves as a convenient wrapper for the `ft_abs` function.

This approach combines the efficiency of inline functions with the ease of use of macros, making it a handy tool for any C programmer needing
